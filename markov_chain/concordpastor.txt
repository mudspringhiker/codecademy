I'm amazed and grateful for the response to what I wrote yesterday regards my Wednesday Texting With God posts.  On my blog, on FaceBook and in messages offline, you've let me know that many of you not only like these particular posts but find them to be your favorites! 

Be sure, then, that the Wednesday "text messages" will continue! 

I'm glad I asked - and I'm grateful that so many of you replied!
